# Crypto_Payments_Integration
* A small repository for storing some general notes on how PaymentSpring could integrate crypto payments 

## Project Goals 

### Problem
* NelNet does not have a way to accept crypto-currency in any of our payments platforms. 
* As a holder ([HODL](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hodl.asp)) of bitcoin, I want to be able to make a
donation using bitcoin so that donation isn't counted as capital gains. 
* As a donor with a lot of btc, I want to make donations using btc so that the donation isn't counted as 
capital gains 

### Business Goals 
* Enable customers to accept new forms of payment 
* Innovate in an emerging payment space
